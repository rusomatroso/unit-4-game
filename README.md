# Star Wars Game

When I was a kid I though the coolest job in the world is being a game maker!
Last few course projects where just a simple games we have to create but I never worked as hard to create anyting! :)))

`respect to all game creators and programmers!!!`

* The game is simple: select a player, select the opponent/enemy, ATTACK!!!
* If you win, you can select the next victim until you run out of enemies.
* Every time you attack the enemy attacks back, you have to watch for your health!
* You or your opponent loose when the health gets to 0 or below.
* Every next time you attack your attack power increases!

Good luck and let the force be with you! ;)
